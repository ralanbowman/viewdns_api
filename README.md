# Documentation for the ViewDNS API

[ViewDNS](http://viewdns.info "ViewDNS") offers a free suite of tools for anyone who needs to test or troubleshoot their DNS setup. You can view the DNS settings for any website, check if your DNS changes have propagated across the Internet, and even see if a website is accessible from behind the Great Firewall of China. 

During my years as a system administrator, and even as a technical writer doing application testing, I made frequent use of the tools available from ViewDNS to help troubleshoot any DNS issues that I encountered. 

ViewDNS offers a [RESTful API](http://viewdns.info/api/ "ViewDNS API") with responses in both JSON and XML. The [existing documentation](http://viewdns.info/api/docs/ "ViewDNS API docs") is workable, but as a technical writer I thought it could be better. I’ve updated a few of their existing API calls to make them more useable and with the needs of a developer in mind. 

**My version is here: [ViewDNS API docs](docs/viewdns-api.md).**

**Note** - I am not affiliated with ViewDNS, I’m just someone who has used their tools for years and thought their API documentation could use some updating.
